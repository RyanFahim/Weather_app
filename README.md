This is a simple Weather application created using React js. 
First copy the url and clone it by using git clone. 
After cloning open the application with an IDE type "npm install" . 
Then go to the src -> component ->Weather.js and give your own OpenWeather api in useEffect fetch api. 
eg. `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${search}&units=metric&appid={Your Key}`. 
Then save it and run the application with "npm start"
